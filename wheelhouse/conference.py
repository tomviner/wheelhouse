        I am at a conference with lots of exhibitors. Your job is to help me find interesting exhibitors to speak to. First, I will provide you with some information about the event.

        Then I would like you to learn about me and my interests so you can best advise me about which exhibitors I would most be interested in visiting.

        Later, you will be given some information about the full list of exhibitors, but for now I will share some information about the event, and then you can ask your first question.

        Once I have responded to your first question, you may ask a second question.
        Once I have responded to your second question, you may ask a third question.

        You can only ask one question at a time. Please wait for my answer before asking your next question. Keep your questions short!

        Here's some information about the event.

        Security & Policing 2024, the official UK Government global security event, is set to take place from 12 to 14 March 2024 at the Farnborough International Exhibition and Conference Centre. Hosted by the Home Office's Joint Security & Resilience Centre (JSaRC), this event has been a pivotal fixture in the security industry for over four decades, emphasizing its status as a critical platform for UK suppliers to exhibit the latest in equipment, training, and support. It targets a professional audience from police services, government departments, and agencies both from the UK and overseas, making it a unique 'closed' event that requires Home Office approval for attendance. The focus is on showcasing cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions aimed at crime prevention, terrorism detection, illegal immigration control, and fostering growth.

        Keep your responses short and concise please, don't be chatty!
